# Privacy Policy for Personal Athletic Optimization System

**Last Updated:** [Date]

## What This Is
This is a simple personal project I built to track and optimize my athletic performance using data from my Oura Ring. I'm the only user of this system.

## What Data I Collect
- Data from your Oura Ring via their official API (sleep, activity, readiness, heart rate, etc.)
- Any notes or manual entries you add to the system

## Where Your Data Goes
- Everything is stored locally in a SQLite database on your personal computer
- Your data never leaves your computer
- No cloud storage, no remote servers, no backups anywhere else

## What I Don't Do
- ❌ Share your data with anyone
- ❌ Sell your data 
- ❌ Send your data to third parties
- ❌ Use your data for advertising
- ❌ Make money from your data in any way
- ❌ Send analytics or telemetry anywhere

## Your Control
- You can delete all your data at any time by deleting the database file
- You can stop the system from accessing your Oura data by revoking API access in your Oura account
- You control everything since it's all on your computer

## Security
Your data is as secure as your personal computer. Use good computer security practices (updates, antivirus, etc.).

## Changes
If I change how this works, I'll update this policy. Since you're the only user and this runs locally, you'll know about any changes when you update the software.

## Questions
This is a personal project for personal use. If you have questions about your data, you can ask me directly since you know who I am.

*This is honest, straightforward privacy policy for a personal project. No corporate nonsense, no hidden agendas.*
